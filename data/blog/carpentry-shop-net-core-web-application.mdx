# Carpentry Shop - Net Core Web Application

![Thubnaim for - Carpentry Shop - Net Core Web Application](/img/carpentry.png)

_You can view a live demo of the application by following this link [178.79.147.9:50](http://178.79.147.9:50/). username: [**\[email protected\]**](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afcecbc2c6c1efc3c0cccec3c7c0dcdb81ccc0c2), password: **P@$$w0r1d**._

Carpentry Shop is my favourite .Net Core Web Application I have built. It is a complete full-stack web application with a database, authentication and elegant design.

### [Features](#features)

- Sends an email when carpentry has been added to the databases or marked as complete by the administrator. When a customer places an order, the email is sent to the administrator. When an order is marked as completed, an email gets sent to the customer.
- Full authentication flow using email and password. The password is encrypted before it gets stored in the database.
- A customer can order as many as possible of carpentries in one order.
- All values entered by the customer get validated before being processed.
- Elegant design

### [Entity Framework](#entity-framework)

I used EF core to integrate with the database, recommended by Microsoft. Entity
framework core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET, and It Supports LINQ
queries, Changes, tracking, updates and schema migration.

The nice thing about EF Core is that it works with many databases. Supported
databases include MySQL, Postgress and Oracle DB. For this project, I used
SQLite.

### [Design and Styles](#design-and-styles)

The design of the web application is styled using Semantic UI. I have enjoyed
working with the UI library. It makes building beautiful websites very easy.

What I enjoy the most about this UI library is its ease of overwriting default styles. The default style looks great for the enterprise application and is lightweight.

### [Deploy and Hosting](#deploy-and-hosting)

I love Linux, So it is not surprising that I hosted this web application on a
Linux server. The challenging part was configuring Apache servers to work with
the
[Kestrel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-7.0)
Web server. A Linux server is so cheap compared to
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). I paid R9O per month for my server
to host the application with a database, which is much less than what I would
have paid if I were to host the application on Azure.

### [Conclusion](#conclusion)

I respect Microsoft for making .Net open source. I will continue using the .Net
Core for building more personal web applications.
