summary: One thing about a job is that the employer chooose for you wich operating system they want you to use during your commute and nine out of 10 is gonna be microst windows. I fall on the majority of that stat :( with that I had to do a lot of configuration to at least make windows usable for me and on this blog I will outline all the configratiion I had to make, maybe you can learn few

It will be no supprice that you will need to install software when trying to
repricate some of thiss configuration so make sure that you havee right to
install software on your work computer or conviced the IT why you need that
sofware lol.

## Power Toy

The first software that I wish it can come as default for window is power toys,
It make it easy for you to set up key map but the most famouse importa feature
is its (power run) think of dmenu or rofi from linux side I use it maily to open
app and change the binding to Win+P. it can do math web search but as I mention
my use of it its quite simple if you prepend the query with `.` it only search
application that are installed on your computer

Cooking something amazing.

## Inline Highlighting

Sample of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
