summary: >
    One thing about a job is that the employer chooses which operating system they
    want you to use during your commute, and nine out of 10 times it's going to be
    Microsoft Windows. I fall into the majority of that statistic :( With that, I
    had to do a lot of configuration to at least make Windows usable for me. On this
    blog, I will outline all the configurations I had to make. Maybe you can learn a
    few things.

It will be no surprise that you will need to install software when trying to
replicate some of this configuration, so make sure that you have the right to
install software on your work computer or convince the IT department why you
need that software.

## PowerToys

The first software that I wish could come as default for Windows is [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/).
It makes it easy for you to set up key mappings, but the most important and
famous feature is Power Run. Think of dmenu or rofi from the Linux side. I
mainly use it to open apps and change the binding to `Win+P`. It can also do math
and web searches, but as I mentioned, my use of it is quite simple. If you
prepend the query with a period, it only searches for applications that are
installed on your computer.


## Alacritty

[Alacritty ](https://alacritty.org/) is better than [Windows terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/), I know some
window fan boy will be mad at me but if you are comming from linux the is no
better therminal in wondows than alacritty as of 2024. also the gosht terminal was just release at the end of 2024 but I haven't
used it to say my opionion about it. beside the stardarad configruation that you
can find on the allacrity docs, I had to add the folling

```
shell : blah blah
```
this is to make sure that when I launch alacritty it start a wsl arc sesion,
more about that on the next


## WSL 2

https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL

Okay, The best thing microsoft ever did is admiting that they have lost to
linux in the debloper community and embend linux in their own operating system.
so I will say this is a must if you are a developer working with windows. it
give you an linux enviroment to work form, the most used one is ubuntu but as a
linux die hard fan I am using arch linux, why? becasue is just better daar :)
your can find the step to install arch linux on WSL 2 here

The are few things to note when working with WSL, 

### opening Windows application from WSL
I was so 

Sample of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`


### Clipboard
Having the yank clip board working whering it accross the system, I only got
this working on neovim, 

_search the thing I still that made this working_


## Tmux

Learn Tmux, it is just the best tool you can add to your development workflow


### Windows Shortcut you need To Know



```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
