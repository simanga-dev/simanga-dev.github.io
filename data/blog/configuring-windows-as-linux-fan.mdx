summary: >
  One thing about a job is that the employer chooses which operating system they
  want you to use during your commute, and nine out of 10 times it's going to be
  Microsoft Windows. I fall into the majority of that statistic :( With that, I
  had to do a lot of configuration to at least make Windows usable for me. On this
  blog, I will outline all the configurations I had to make. Maybe you can learn a
  few things.

_It will be no surprise that you will need to install software when trying to
replicate some of this configuration, make sure that you have the right to
install software on your work computer or convince the IT department why you
need that software_

## PowerToys

The first software that I wish could come as default for Windows is [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/).
It makes it easy for you to set up key mappings, but the most important and
its famous feature is Power Run. Think of [dmenu ](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) or [rofi ](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) from the Linux side. I
mainly use it to open apps and do math on the fly. I currently have it bind to `Win+P`.
PowerToys can do more such as searching the web and search files but my use of
it is pretty much basic.

## Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) is superior to [Windows terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/). I understand that some Windows
enthusiasts may disagree with me, but for those transitioning from Linux, there
is currently no better terminal option in Windows than **Alacritty** as of 2024.
I know the Ghost Terminal was recently released at the end of 2024, but I
have not yet had the opportunity to form an opinion on it. In addition to the
standard configuration provided in the Alacritty documentation, I had to add the
following:

```bash

...

[terminal.shell]
program = "wsl.exe"
args = ["--cd", "~"]

[window]
# opacity = 0.95
decorations = "None"

```

This is to ensure that when I launch Alacritty, it starts a WSL session.
More about that later

## WSL 2

Okay, the best thing Microsoft ever did was admit that they have lost to Linux
in the developer community and embed Linux in their own operating system. So, I
will say this is a must if you are a developer working with Windows. It gives
you a Linux environment to work from. The most used one is Ubuntu, but as a
Linux die-hard fan, I am using Arch Linux. Why? Because it is simply better. You
can find the steps to install Arch Linux on WSL 2 [here](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).

There are a few things to note when working with WSL.

### Opening Windows application from WSL

When using WSL the are some times where you want to open file explore in the
current folder or notepad. You can be able to do so by running

```bash
explore.exe .
```

or

```
notepad.exe
```

You can even take it further and open Excel files or access the environment
variables using [WSLU](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu?tab=readme-ov-file), which is a tool that enhances the experience of WSL



### Clipboard

I also had some trouble sharing the clipboard on my [Neovim ](https://neovim.io/) with
the Windows system. The following configuration helps, although it reduces the
performance of copying and pasting in Neovim.


```lua
-- init.lua
if vim.fn.has 'wsl' == 1 then
  vim.g.clipboard = {
    name = 'WslClipboard',
    copy = {
      ['+'] = 'clip.exe',
      ['*'] = 'clip.exe',
    },
    paste = {
      ['+'] = 'powershell.exe -c [Console]::Out.Write($(Get-Clipboard -Raw).tostring().replace("`r", ""))',
      ['*'] = 'powershell.exe -c [Console]::Out.Write($(Get-Clipboard -Raw).tostring().replace("`r", ""))',
    },
    cache_enabled = 0,
  }
end

```

## Tmux

One of the tools I use frequently is [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). **Tmux** is a bit complex, but at its
core, it is a terminal multiplexer. In short, it ensures that when you close the
terminal window, the programs that were running continue to run in the
background. This allows you to pick up where you left off when you reopen the
terminal, which is convenient since you will likely be closing and opening the
Alacritty terminal often.

I have added this to a ```.zshrc``` file that allows me to automatically re-attach to
a tmux session if it exists, or create one if it does not.

```
# Check if already in a tmux session
if [ -n "$TMUX" ]; then
    echo "Already in a tmux session"
else
    # Check if the tmux session named "default" already exists
    if ! tmux has-session -t default 2>/dev/null; then
        # If the session does not exist, create a new one
        tmux new-session -s default -A
    else
        # If the session already exists, attach to it
        tmux attach-session -t default
    fi
fi
```

## Windows shortcuts you need to know and window management.

There are a few shortcuts that you need to know on Windows to make your life easier.

- Closing / a Window ``` Alt+F4```
- Maximize a current window ```Win+Up```

With those two shorcut your configuration is almost complete since you can be
able to open applications using PowerToys, maximize them, and close them
without touching the mouse.

With that being said, you can stop here and I think you will have a better setup
on Windows. But if you want to take it further, carry on.

One thing that I like about Linux is that there are many software options that
allow you to customize key mappings. The first thing I usually change on a
machine is to map the Caps Lock key to ESC. I have found that the software that
works best on both Linux and Windows is [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata). I have also used Kanata to set
up my home row mods. Here is the full configuration for my Kanata software.


```

;; defsrc is still necessary

(defcfg
  process-unmapped-keys yes
)

(defsrc
  caps a s d f h j k l ;
  f5 , . spc p y
)

(defvar
  tap-time 250
  hold-time 250
)

(defalias
  escctrl (tap-hold 150 200 esc (layer-toggle num) )
  a (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time a lmet)
  s (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time s lsft)
  d (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time d lalt)
  f (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time f lctl)

  j (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time j rctl)
  k (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time k ralt)
  l (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time l rsft)
  ; (tap-hold $tap-time $hold-time ; rmet)
  cpy S-C-c
  pst S-ins
  bak C-bspc
)

(deflayer base
 @escctrl  @a @s @d @f h @j @k @l @;
  lrld  , . spc p y
)


(deflayer num
  esc @a @s @d @f @bak down up @l @;
  f5 left rght rpt @pst @cpy
)


```

I am aware this might be a little bit too much but honestly just read the [docs](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/config.adoc)
you will understand what is going on.
