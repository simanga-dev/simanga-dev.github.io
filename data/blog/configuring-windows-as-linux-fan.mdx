summary: >
  One thing about a job is that the employer chooses which operating system they
  want you to use during your commute, and nine out of 10 times it's going to be
  Microsoft Windows. I fall into the majority of that statistic :( With that, I
  had to do a lot of configuration to at least make Windows usable for me. On this
  blog, I will outline all the configurations I had to make. Maybe you can learn a
  few things.

It will be no surprise that you will need to install software when trying to
replicate some of this configuration, so make sure that you have the right to
install software on your work computer or convince the IT department why you
need that software.

## PowerToys

The first software that I wish could come as default for Windows is [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/).
It makes it easy for you to set up key mappings, but the most important and
famous feature is Power Run. Think of dmenu or rofi from the Linux side. I
mainly use it to open apps and change the binding to `Win+P`. It can also do math
and web searches, but as I mentioned, my use of it is quite simple. If you
prepend the query with a period, it only searches for applications that are
installed on your computer.

## Alacritty

[Alacritty ](https://alacritty.org/) is better than [Windows terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/), I know some
window fan boy will be mad at me but if you are comming from linux the is no
better therminal in wondows than alacritty as of 2024. also the gosht terminal was just release at the end of 2024 but I haven't
used it to say my opionion about it. beside the stardarad configruation that you
can find on the allacrity docs, I had to add the folling

```bash

[terminal.shell]
program = "wsl.exe"
args = ["--cd", "~"]

---

[window]
# opacity = 0.95
decorations = "None"

```

this is to make sure that when I launch alacritty it start a wsl arc sesion,
more about that on the next

## WSL 2

Okay, the best thing Microsoft ever did was admitting that they have lost to
Linux in the developer community and embedding Linux in their own operating
system. So, I will say this is a must if you are a developer working with
Windows. It gives you a Linux environment to work from. The most used one is
Ubuntu, but as a Linux die-hard fan, I am using Arch Linux. Why? Because it is
just better. You can find the steps to install Arch Linux on WSL 2 here.

The are few things to note when working with WSL,

### opening Windows application from WSL

When using WSL the are some times where you want to open file explore in the
current folder or notepad. You can be able to do so by
``explore.exe``or` notepad.exe ```. You can even take it futher and open
execl files or getting enviroment using wslu wich is a bunch that improve the
experience

### Clipboard

I also have some trouble to share clipboard on my neovim config with the
windows system but the following config help althour they reudce the perfomace
of copying and pasting in neovim

```lua
-- init.lua
if vim.fn.has 'wsl' == 1 then
  vim.g.clipboard = {
    name = 'WslClipboard',
    copy = {
      ['+'] = 'clip.exe',
      ['*'] = 'clip.exe',
    },
    paste = {
      ['+'] = 'powershell.exe -c [Console]::Out.Write($(Get-Clipboard -Raw).tostring().replace("`r", ""))',
      ['*'] = 'powershell.exe -c [Console]::Out.Write($(Get-Clipboard -Raw).tostring().replace("`r", ""))',
    },
    cache_enabled = 0,
  }
end

```

## Tmux

One of the took I use a lot is Tmux, Tmux is a litle bit complex but at its core
is a terminal multiplex, short it make sure that when you close the terminal
window the programe that were running continu to run in the back ground so that
when you open the terminal you can continue where you left, which is a litle bit
convinience,
