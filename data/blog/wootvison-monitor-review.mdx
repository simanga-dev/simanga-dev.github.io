React Server Components. Read on to discover the new features and how to migrate
from V1.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## Features

#### Refresh Rate: 180Hz

I have nevers used a monitor with hight refresh rate before and using one is a
mile difference to a starndard monitor, things like watchimgn movigs make it
much smoother and but I don't game a lot so I am sure I am not using the full
capabalites of the high refress monitor

#### 27" IPS (In-Plane Switching) Panel

#### Color Gamut: 100% SRGB

#### Brightness: 300 nits

#### Resolution: WQHD (2560x1440)

As a sofware developer, honestly the resolution is good enough, you can easy
open two app side to side with enough room tow squash, but then again... I don't
game alot so take this with a grain of solt

![Github Traffic](/static/images/github-traffic.png)

The template was first released in January 2021 and has since been used by thousands of users. It is featured on [Next.js Templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog), [Tailwind Awesome](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/resources/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) among other listing sites. It attracts 200+ unique visitors daily notching 1500-2000 page views, with 1.3k forks and many other clones.

Many thanks to the community of users and contributors for making this template
a success! I created a small video montage of the blogs (while cleaning up the
list in the readme) to showcase the diversity of the blogs created using the
template and to celebrate the milestone:

Version 2 builds on the success of the previous version and introduces many new
features and improvements. The codebase has been refactored to support Next.js
App directory and React Server Components. Markdown / MDX is now processed using
Contentlayer, a type-safe content SDK that validates and transforms your content
into type-safe JSON data. It integrates with Pliny, a new library that provides
out of the box Next.js components to enhance your static site with analytics,
comments and newsletter subscription. A new command palette (âŒ˜-k) search
component is also added to the template.

Let's dive into the new features and improvements in V2.

## My Experience Using it with Linux Hyprland

Now that [Next.js App router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) is finally stable and
is mostly feature compatible with Page Router, the codebase has been migrated to
new setup. This allows for a hybrid rendering approach, with the use of React
Server Components generated on the server side for faster page loads and smaller
bundle sizes, while retaining the ability to sprinkle in client side React
components for interactivity.[^1]

With addition powers comes a [new
paradigm](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) to learn. I
have migrated the codebase to make use of the new features as much as possible.
This includes changes in the folder structure, splitting components into server
vs client components, leveraging server side data fetching and using the
recommended
[Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)
API for SEO discoverability.

While this simplifies the codebase to some extent, it makes migration from the
old codebase more difficult. If you are looking to migrate, I recommend starting
from a fresh template and copying over your customizations and existing content.
See the [migration recommendations](#migration-recommendations) section for more
details.

## Conclusion

_I love it _
The codebase has been migrated to Typescript. While the previous version of the
template was available in both Javascript and Typescript, I decided to reduce
the maintenance burden and focus on Typescript. This also allows for better type
checking and code completion in IDEs.

Typescript is also a perfect match with our new type-safe markdown processor - Contentlayer.
